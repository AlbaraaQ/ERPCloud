# ADMIN_PANEL_MASTER_REQUIREMENTS

> Level C — aggregated from all module requirements (single canonical file per §17/§19
> consolidation decision; phases extend their module section here, not separate files).
> App: `apps/admin` (Next.js 15, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, RHF+zod via
> `@erp/contracts`). RTL-first (ar default, ar/en switch), tenant timezone rendering.

## 0. Global Shell (all modules inherit)

- Shell: sidebar (module groupings below), topbar (tenant + branch switcher
  `X-Branch-Id`, user menu, notifications bell, global search `Ctrl+K`),
  breadcrumbs, RTL layout.
- Table kit: server pagination/sort/filter toolbar, column chooser (persist per user —
  legacy CustomizedDGV equivalent), CSV export where allowed, empty/loading/error states
  mandatory (`EmptyState`, `TableSkeleton`, `ErrorState` components).
- Form kit: zod-validated, dirty-guard, sticky action bar, inline field errors, disable
  on immutable docs (posted), optimistic-lock conflict dialog (`VERSION_CONFLICT`).
- Feedback: toast on success; problem+json `detail` surfaced; `traceId` copy button.
- Permission-driven rendering (hide, not disable, when no view perm).
- Dashboard home: KPIs (today sales, cash, AR overdue, low stock count), charts
  (sales trend, top categories/items — legacy MonthlySales/GetSalesByCategory parity),
  quick actions, pending items (drafts, failed e-invoices, unlocked periods).
- Print: browser print CSS + PDF artifacts from API where listed.

## 1. Platform & Settings module

Screens: Tenant profile/settings editor (typed keys w/ descriptions) · Users &
memberships (invite, branch scope, discount limits — legacy OperMaxDiscount UI) ·
Roles & permissions matrix (module×action grid) · Audit log explorer (entity filter,
diff viewer) · Files manager · Notifications center · Sequences/numbering admin ·
Feature flags (vertical packs).
Tables: users(email,status,last_login), audit(time,actor,entity,action,diff).
Perms: platform.*. Actions: invite/reset-password/suspend/resend.

> Backend readiness after PHASE_04 (the screens themselves land in PHASE_17):
> - Audit log explorer — `GET /audit-log` with `entity/entityId/action/actorUserId/from/to`
>   filters; each row already carries `before`/`after`, so the diff viewer needs no extra
>   endpoint.
> - Files manager — `GET /files` (filter `status`/`entity`, search by name),
>   `GET /files/{id}`, presign/finalize, and a short-lived signed download link.
> - Notifications center — `GET /notifications` (+ `meta.unread`), mark-read,
>   `POST /notifications`.
> - Sequences/numbering admin — **service only** (`SequencesService.peek/configure`); no
>   HTTP surface yet, because PHASE_04 §5.6 scopes sequences to the allocation service.
>   The screen needs read/update endpoints for `document_sequences`; whichever phase
>   builds it must add them (prefix/padding are editable, `current_value` must not be
>   rewindable).
> - Feature flags — already covered by the typed settings editor (`feature.*` keys).

## 2. Organization module

Screens: Company profile form (+ ZATCA national address sub-form, logo upload to S3) ·
Branches CRUD (+ posting profile tab per doc type) · Warehouses CRUD · Cash locations
CRUD (safe/bank, bank JSON block, balances view) · Currencies & FX rates grid ·
Price lists (items side-panel pricing editor) · Fiscal calendar viewer (link to
accounting). Empty states guide first-time setup (onboarding checklist widget).

Backend capabilities available to these screens beyond the list above (PHASE_05, aligned
2026-09-05): a **rate preview** (`GET /fx-rates/resolve`) that reports whether a number is
direct, inverse or triangulated and through which pivot — the grid should show the source,
not just the number; a **posting-profile preview** (`GET /branch-posting-profiles/resolve`)
that shows which rung of the branch→tenant fallback chain a document would actually use;
IBANs arrive **masked in lists** and unmasked only on the detail read, so a grid must not
be built to expect the full value; "activate" and "make default" are PATCH fields on the
row (with an optimistic-concurrency `version`), not separate actions; and delete is a soft
delete, so the UI should say "archive" and expect the code to become re-usable.


## 3. Catalog module

Screens: Categories tree (drag-reorder, POS flags, kitchen printer) · Items list
(advanced filters: category/kind/tax/barcoded/stock state; bulk ops: import CSV,
export) · Item editor (tabs: general, units & barcodes, pricing incl. price lists,
components/BOM, tax & codes (Egy GS1 fields), images, alternative codes, details
(importer/weight/lead time), history (price changes)) · Units CRUD · Tax groups CRUD.

Statements: Trial Balance (expand tree, drill to GL), General Ledger (account/date/
branch), Account Statement party view link. Perms + accounting.guardrail banners
(period closed strips).

## 5. Parties (customers & suppliers)

highlight) · Item movement (ledger timeline incl. doc links) · Stock adjustments
(list + editor with counted vs system diff columns, approve action w/ perm) · Stock

method preview (qty/value) and landed-cost effect per line, supplier reference/date
fields. Backend Phase 11 endpoints are available for invoice CRUD, posting, voiding,
payment hooks, costs management, and landed-cost preview. Receiving note shortcut from
invoice remains an admin UX composition over the purchase post endpoint.

## 9. Treasury module

Screens: Vouchers list (kind tabs receipt/payment, method filter) · Voucher editor

actions clear/bounce, allocations table to open invoices with auto-suggest oldest-first)

board (+ per-currency chips) · Shift closes: open/current screen (live counters),
