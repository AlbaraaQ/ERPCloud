# PHASE 04 IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

Platform Services — audit trail, files, notifications, background jobs with a
transactional outbox, document sequences, and durable idempotency keys.

## Phase Report — PH-04

**Delivered**

- **Schema & migration** — `packages/database/migrations/0001_platform_services.sql`
  (238 lines) creates the six tables of `DATABASE_DESIGN §3–§4` (`audit_log, files,
  notifications, outbox_jobs, idempotency_keys, document_sequences`) with the indexes the
  design lists, and `migrations/down/0001_platform_services.down.sql` (38 lines) reverses
  it. Verified against a real PostgreSQL 16 cluster:
  `up → applied`, `up → skipped`, `down → applied`, `up → applied` again, ending at
  **16 tables, 11 policies, 11 relations with `ENABLE`+`FORCE` RLS**, and
  `information_schema.role_table_grants` showing `erp_api` holding only `SELECT, INSERT`
  on `audit_log`.
- **Audit** (`PHASE_04 §5.2`, `SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE §9–§10`) — a global
  `AuditInterceptor` records every **successful** mutating request
  (`entity/action/actorUserId/actorLabel/after/meta{method,path,status,traceId,ip,userAgent}`)
  and auth events including failures. A service that knows the previous state writes the
  row itself, inside its transaction, with a real `before` — `PUT /settings/{key}` does
  exactly that — and calls `markRequestAudited()` so the interceptor stands down and
  exactly one row is produced per request. `AuditService.record/recordInTx` is the
  explicit API later modules use for domain events. Redaction is structural: any key
  matching `pass|secret|token|credential|authorization|hash|mfa|otp|pin|*key` is replaced
  with `[redacted]` at any depth, in `before`, `after` and `meta`, before the row is
  written.
- **Files** (`PHASE_04 §5.3`, `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE §8`) — `POST /files/presign` → client
  PUT straight to storage → `POST /files/{id}/finalize` → `GET /files/{id}/download`
  (app-signed URL) → `GET /files/{id}/content` (302 to the storage pre-signed GET). The
  SigV4 presigner is implemented in-repo and verified against the AWS reference vector;
  object keys are `tenants/{tid}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{fileId}/{safeName}`, so a leaked key is
  useless in another tenant. MIME allow-list and size ceiling are enforced *before* a URL
  is minted, attachments are refused unless the entity has a registered validator (422),
  and a `pending` row older than `FILES_ORPHAN_GC_HOURS` is collected by the
  `maintenance` job — row soft-deleted first, object removed best-effort second.
- **Notifications** (`PHASE_04 §5.4`) — membership-scoped inbox (`GET /notifications`
  with `meta.unread`, `GET /notifications/{id}`, `POST /notifications/{id}/read`,
  `POST /notifications`). The demo subscription is real: `PUT /settings/{key}` emits
  `settings.updated` on the in-process bus after commit, and the subscriber writes the
  inbox row **and** the `notification.email` outbox job in one transaction.
- **Jobs** (`PHASE_04 §5.5`) — queues `einvoice, notifications, reports-export,
  migration, maintenance` behind a `QueuePort`; BullMQ is imported lazily so nothing
  opens a socket when `REDIS_URL` is absent. Producers never publish from a business
  transaction: they write `outbox_jobs`, and `OutboxPublisher` claims rows
  `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, publishes inside the same transaction, retries with
  exponential backoff capped at one hour and dead-letters at `OUTBOX_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.
  `WORKER=1` boots the same image as an application context (no HTTP listener) with the
  consumers, the drain loop, the maintenance jobs and a periodic health log.
  `GET /jobs/outbox` and `GET /jobs/health` expose the state.
- **Sequences** (`PHASE_04 §5.6`, BL-1) — `SequencesService.next({tenantId, docType,
  branchId?, fiscalYearId?}, tx?)` allocates through a single
  `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE … RETURNING`, joining the caller's transaction so a
  rolled-back document never burns a number. Returns `{value, prefix, padding, display}`.
  64 parallel allocations yield 64 distinct, gap-free values.
- **Idempotency** (`PHASE_04 §5.7`) — the Phase-02 in-memory map is gone. Claims are
  written to `idempotency_keys` before the handler runs, so two concurrent requests with
  one key cannot both execute; the stored response is replayed **byte-identically** with
  `Idempotency-Replayed: true`; a reused key with a different payload is
  `409 IDEMPOTENCY_REPLAY`; a failed handler releases the claim so the client can retry;
  expired rows are swept by the `maintenance` job.
- **Isolation** — the `TESTING_STRATEGY §6` harness is applied unchanged to `files` and
  `notifications` (all four proofs, including a raw cross-tenant `INSERT` rejected with
  SQLSTATE `42501`), and the tables with no CRUD surface (`audit_log`, `outbox_jobs`,
  `idempotency_keys`, `document_sequences`) are proved at the RLS layer.

**Deviations**

- `PUT /settings/{key}` with an unknown key now returns **400 `VALIDATION_FAILED`**
  instead of the Phase-02 404. Required by `PHASE_04 §5.8`; recorded as **CR-004**,
  `API_CONTRACT §2` annotated and `settings.spec.ts` updated.
- Endpoints beyond the three the contract lists for platform services (`GET /files`,
  `GET /files/{id}`, `POST /files/{id}/finalize`, `GET /files/{id}/download`,
  `GET /files/{id}/content`, `GET /notifications/{id}`, `POST /notifications`,
  `GET /jobs/outbox`, `GET /jobs/health`) plus the permission codes
  `platform.notification.view|manage` and `platform.job.view`. Recorded as **CR-005**;
  `SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE §5` and `API_CONTRACT §2` updated.
- `GET /files/{id}/content` is the only unauthenticated route in the application. A
  browser download cannot carry a bearer token, so the capability is an HMAC signature
  over `(fileId, tenantId, expiry)`; the tenant is read from the signed payload, never
  from the request. Tampered, expired and cross-tenant signatures are all 401 (tested).
- `idempotency_keys.response` is `text`, not the `jsonb` of `DATABASE_DESIGN §4`. jsonb
  normalises key order, which would break the byte-identical replay the same document's
  `API_CONTRACT §0` promises. Noted inline in `DATABASE_DESIGN §4`.
- `document_sequences` uses a surrogate `id` plus a unique index over
  `(tenant_id, coalesce(branch_id, nil), doc_type, coalesce(fiscal_year_id, nil))` rather
  than the literal PK of `DATABASE_DESIGN §3`: a PostgreSQL primary key containing NULLs
  cannot enforce "one row per scope", which is the property the allocator depends on.
- `PlatformServicesModule` is `@Global()`. `modules/platform` (settings) needs
  `AuditService` and this module's controllers need the guards exported by
  `modules/platform`; an `imports:` edge either way is a module cycle.
- Mailer and virus scanner are **ports with stub adapters** (`ConsoleMailer`,
  `NoopVirusScanner`) — explicitly the phase's out-of-scope instruction (`§14`). The scan
  verdict is still recorded in the file's audit meta, so "was this scanned?" is
  answerable from data.
- `audit_log`'s RLS policy is not the canonical template: `tenant_id` is nullable for
  platform-plane events, so `WITH CHECK` uses `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM <guc>`. Those rows
  are write-only for `erp_api` — no tenant session can read them back.
- **Environment gap:** Docker is unavailable in this build environment, so MinIO, Redis
  and MailHog could not be started. The presign→finalize→download flow was exercised
  end-to-end against an in-memory `OBJECT_STORAGE` adapter and the BullMQ hop against a
  recording `QueuePort`; the SigV4 signature itself is verified against the AWS
  reference vector, and everything touching PostgreSQL (all RLS, concurrency and
  immutability proofs) ran against a real server. Running the acceptance flow against
  live MinIO/Redis remains an open verification item — see Follow-ups.

explorer, files manager, notifications centre and feature flags are backed by endpoints;
**sequences/numbering admin is service-only** — it needs read/update endpoints from
whichever phase builds the screen), `apps/api/.env.example`.

**CRs opened** — CR-004, CR-005.

**Seeds/Env changes** — no new seed. New environment variables, all defaulted so an
existing `.env` keeps working: `S3_REGION`, `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`,
`S3_PRESIGN_EXPIRY_SECONDS`, `FILES_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, `FILES_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES`,
`FILES_DOWNLOAD_URL_TTL_SECONDS`, `FILES_ORPHAN_GC_HOURS`, `WORKER`, `JOBS_ENABLED`,
`JOB_QUEUE_PREFIX`, `OUTBOX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, `OUTBOX_BATCH_SIZE`,
`OUTBOX_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `OUTBOX_BACKOFF_BASE_MS`, `WORKER_HEALTH_LOG_INTERVAL_MS`,
`IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_HOURS`, `MAIL_TRANSPORT`, `MAIL_FROM`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`,
`FILE_URL_SIGNING_SECRET`. New runtime dependency: `bullmq@^5.34` (loaded lazily).
`pnpm db:migrate` must be re-run for `0001_platform_services.sql`.

**Carried into later phases (explicit hand-offs)**

- `document_sequences.branch_id` / `fiscal_year_id` carry **no FK**: `branches` arrives in
  PHASE_05 and the fiscal calendar in PHASE_07. Both migrations must add the constraint —
  the omission is commented in `0001_platform_services.sql` and in the Drizzle schema.
- `FileAttachmentRegistry` is empty, so every `entity` on a presign/finalize is a 422
  today. PHASE_05 registers `company_profiles` (logo) as the first validator.
- Sequences have no HTTP surface; PHASE_05 consumes them through the service.

**Follow-ups**

- Run the acceptance flow against the docker-compose stack (MinIO + Redis + MailHog) in
  an environment that has Docker; the code paths are complete and stubbed only at the
  network boundary.
- Real SMTP/SES adapter behind `MailerPort` and a ClamAV adapter behind
  `VirusScannerPort` (deferred by `PHASE_04 §14`).
- Register attachment validators as business entities land (`FileAttachmentRegistry` is
  empty by design in this phase, so every `entity` is a 422 today).
- Redis-backed rate limiting still carries its `TODO(phase:23)`.
- BullMQ repeatable schedulers currently enqueue maintenance jobs at worker start with an
  hour-bucketed `jobId`; move to `repeatable` job options once a scheduler owner exists.
- Coverage gate from `TESTING_STRATEGY §3` is still not enforced in CI.
