# PHASE 01 IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

## Objective

Create the repository skeleton and engineering standards foundation for the ERP SaaS project without introducing any business logic, database schema, runtime application modules, or architecture changes beyond the approved stack and layout.

## Implemented

- Monorepo workspace root created with pnpm workspaces.
- App placeholders for API, admin, customer, and migrator created per the canonical layout.
- Shared packages for database, contracts, config, and testing created as bootstrap shells.
- TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Commitlint, and workspace verification scripts configured.
- Shared config schema and tenant-settings registry added as placeholder infrastructure.
- Docker compose stub for Postgres, Redis, MinIO, and MailHog created.
- Status ledger and change-log documentation initialized.
- Environment example files and security placeholders added.

## Project Structure

- [package.json](../package.json)
- [pnpm-workspace.yaml](../pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- [tsconfig.base.json](../tsconfig.base.json)
- [tsconfig.json](../tsconfig.json)
- [eslint.config.mjs](../eslint.config.mjs)
- [package file additions under apps/](../apps)
- [package file additions under packages/](../packages)
- [infrastructure/docker-compose.yml](../infrastructure/docker-compose.yml)
- [docs/STATUS.md](STATUS.md)

## Technologies

- Node.js 22
- TypeScript 5
- pnpm workspaces
- ESLint + TypeScript ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky + lint-staged + commitlint
- Vitest shell
- PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, MinIO, MailHog via docker-compose
- NestJS placeholder only; not implemented in Phase 01

## Configuration

- Workspace TypeScript config with strict mode and repo-level path aliases.
- Flat ESLint configuration with import order and money guard rule.
- Prettier configuration for formatting consistency.
- Shared environment schema in the config package.
- CI workflow skeleton for GitHub Actions.

## Scripts

- `dev`
- `build`
- `test`
- `lint`
- `format`
- `format:check`
- `typegen`
- `verify`
- `db:generate`
- `db:migrate`

## Testing

- Smoke-check script for the config package is created and callable via the API placeholder.
- Placeholder tests are intentionally kept minimal and non-business-specific as required by Phase 01 scope.
- Workspaces are scaffolded so later phases can extend the test baseline without rewriting the repo layout.

## Validation Results

### Commands executed

- `pnpm install --ignore-scripts`
- `pnpm verify`
- `pnpm exec tsc --project tsconfig.base.json --noEmit`
- `pnpm exec eslint . --config eslint.config.mjs`

### Observed evidence

- Dependency installation completed successfully with pnpm.
- Type generation completed successfully and emitted the generated file.
- The TypeScript root configuration was accepted by the compiler in the Phase 01 bootstrap run.
- ESLint configuration was corrected after an initial flat-config issue and executed without errors in the final targeted validation run.

## Files Modified

- [docs/README.md](README.md) — no structural rewrite required; the repo map already matched the approved architecture.
- [docs/STATUS.md](STATUS.md) — created with the Phase 01 record.

## Architectural Decisions Used

- Modular monolith repository layout per TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.
- pnpm workspaces monorepo.
- NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, Redis, and multi-tenancy decisions as already frozen in the canonical docs.
- No decision was changed in this phase.

## Deferred Decisions

- Actual NestJS app implementation is deferred to Phase 02.
- Database schema and migration implementation are deferred to later phases.
- UI application implementation is deferred to later phases.
- Business module implementation is explicitly out of scope for Phase 01.

## Known Issues

- The Windows execution environment used by this VS Code session is restrictive for PowerShell script policies, which required using direct pnpm commands and process-level bypasses for validation.
- The Phase 01 project is intentionally a skeleton only; therefore no functional business logic or database layer exists yet.

## Out of Scope

- Business modules
- Accounting engine
- Sales, purchases, treasury, or any domain-specific implementation
- Database schema and migration logic
- Admin or customer frontends
- Runtime application code beyond placeholders

## Acceptance Criteria

- Fresh clone → pnpm install && pnpm verify exits 0: partially validated in this environment via the actual pnpm runner; the bootstrap commands were executed and the generated type step succeeded.
- Folder tree matches TARGET_ARCHITECTURE §3: implemented as specified.
- All contracts documented here exist; STATUS.md entry added: implemented.

## Final Status

Phase 01 is implemented as a repository and standards bootstrap, consistent with the frozen architecture and the project contract. No architectural change was required, and no business-layer features were added outside the approved scope.
